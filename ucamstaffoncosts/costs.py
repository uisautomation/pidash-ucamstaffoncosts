Costs calculation
=================

The :py:mod:`~ucamstaffoncosts.costs` module provides support for calculating the total cost to
employ a staff member. The functionality of the module is exposed through a single function,
:py:func:`~ucamstaffoncosts.costs.cost`, which takes a tax year, pension scheme and base salary and
returns an :py:class:`~ucamstaffoncosts.Cost` object representing the on-costs for that employee:

.. testsetup::

    from ucamstaffoncosts.costs import *
    import datetime

>>> calculate_cost(
...     base_salary=25000, scheme=Scheme.USS, year=2018
... ) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE, +ELLIPSIS
Cost(salary=25000, exchange=0, employer_pension=4500,
     employer_nic=2287, apprenticeship_levy=125, total=31912, tax_year=...)

The :py:attr:`~ucamstaffoncosts.Cost.total` attribute from the return value
can be used to forecast total expenditure for an employee in a given tax year.

If *year* is omitted, then the latest tax year which has any calculators
implemented is used. This behaviour can also be signalled by using the special
value :py:const:`~ucamstaffoncosts.LATEST`:

>>> latest_cost = calculate_cost(base_salary=25000, scheme=Scheme.USS, year=LATEST)
>>> latest_cost == calculate_cost(base_salary=25000, scheme=Scheme.USS)
True

We can get a detailed breakdown of costs for each tax year using the :py:func:`.costs_by_tax_year`
function. Our example employee will be a grade 2 whose next employment anniversary is on the 1st
June 2016. The employee on on the USS salary exchange pension scheme and has a first date of
non-employment of 1st October 2020:

>>> from ucamstaffoncosts import Grade
>>> from ucamstaffoncosts.salary.scales import EXAMPLE_SALARY_SCALES
>>> initial_grade = Grade.GRADE_2
>>> initial_point = EXAMPLE_SALARY_SCALES.starting_point_for_grade(initial_grade)
>>> next_anniversary_date = datetime.date(2016, 6, 1)
>>> scheme = Scheme.USS_EXCHANGE
>>> until_date = datetime.date(2020, 10, 1)

We can calculate the total cost of employment by passing these values to :

>>> costs = list(costs_by_tax_year(
...     2016, initial_grade, initial_point, scheme,
...     next_anniversary_date=next_anniversary_date,
...     until_date=until_date, scale_table=EXAMPLE_SALARY_SCALES))

We can print out details of these costs to fully explain the cost calculation:

>>> from ucamstaffoncosts.util import pprinttable
>>> for year, cost, salaries in costs:
...     print('=' * 60)
...     print('TAX YEAR: {}/{}'.format(year, year+1))
...     print('\\nSalaries\\n--------\\n')
...     pprinttable(salaries)
...     print('\\nCosts\\n-----')
...     if cost.tax_year != year:
...         print('(approximated using tax tables for {})'.format(cost.tax_year))
...     print('\\n')
...     pprinttable([cost])
...     print('\\n') # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
